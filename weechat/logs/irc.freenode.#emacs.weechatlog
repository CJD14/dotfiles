2015-04-28 13:00:14	forcer	cestdiego: There are some modes that try to get that - e.g. multiple-major-modes (mumamo) - but they are all just limited work-arounds for something Emacs really does not do well.
2015-04-28 13:00:25	wasamasa	cestdiego: org just copies fontified sources from a temporary buffer
2015-04-28 13:00:31	wasamasa	cestdiego: that's why it breaks for web-mode!
2015-04-28 13:00:38	cestdiego	web-mode also makes it kinda possible. but it implements it's own way of modes. We need to use the modes that we have already installed
2015-04-28 13:00:43	wasamasa	cestdiego: because it's doing its own trickery for font-locking and multimodes and whatnot
