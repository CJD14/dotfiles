2015-04-28 12:51:57	capella-da-star	That's cool. I used to enjoy it too. These days, It's mostly using Vim to write code and ensuring that the tooling doesn't gets in the way.
2015-04-28 12:52:48	capella-da-star	Sometimes, we are so obsessed with the tooling, we forget the real purpose. But that's mostly my person opinion. Might not be true to others.
2015-04-28 12:52:49	baxx	capella-da-star: i understand, i have to learn for now though... do you knwo what I've done wrong here?

2015-04-28 12:57:02	capella-da-star	I think if your regex is wrong, you can find the correct one there. It's mostly about regex with these sort of plugins. Right?

Problem is that the first error catches the :compileJava line above, e.g, with errorformat=%f:%l:\ error:\ %m, ":compileJava\nsome/path/somefile.java:someline :error: errormessage" reports the error being in file :compileJavasome/path/somefile.java. How do I circumvent this?
