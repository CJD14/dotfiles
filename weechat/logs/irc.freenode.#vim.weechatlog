2015-04-28 12:51:57	capella-da-star	That's cool. I used to enjoy it too. These days, It's mostly using Vim to write code and ensuring that the tooling doesn't gets in the way.
2015-04-28 12:52:48	capella-da-star	Sometimes, we are so obsessed with the tooling, we forget the real purpose. But that's mostly my person opinion. Might not be true to others.
2015-04-28 12:52:49	baxx	capella-da-star: i understand, i have to learn for now though... do you knwo what I've done wrong here?

Problem is that the first error catches the :compileJava line above, e.g, with errorformat=%f:%l:\ error:\ %m, ":compileJava\nsome/path/somefile.java:someline :error: errormessage" reports the error being in file :compileJavasome/path/somefile.java. How do I circumvent this?
