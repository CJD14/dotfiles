2015-04-28 12:52:51	DIEHLC	hello everyone, is there a way to get Weechat and Tmux to work together right? I need to refresh the screen constantly.. tmux makes it so the whole page doesnt scroll, and when switching buffers it leaves text from the last buffer.
2015-04-28 12:53:12	Yaniel	hmm?
2015-04-28 12:53:19	Yaniel	page up/page down scrolls weechat just fine
2015-04-28 12:53:36	Kunsi	DIEHLC: weechat and tmux work fine here
2015-04-28 12:53:41	Yaniel	what terminal are you using?
2015-04-28 12:53:50	DIEHLC	not for me for whatever reason. Idk why. hmmm weird... im using Gnome-terminal
2015-04-28 12:54:35	Yaniel	I sometimes get old chars not cleared when using mosh in fingerterm to connect to the machine with weechat/tmux
2015-04-28 12:54:43	DIEHLC	it works for the most part but when i join a channel, I still have the MTOD on the screen from the last. But after I refress it works until the screen fills. its strange
2015-04-28 12:54:54	DIEHLC	*refresh
2015-04-28 12:55:26	DIEHLC	well anyway to make the window refresh command run every so often or something?
2015-04-28 12:56:45	Yaniel	check your $TERM
2015-04-28 12:57:34	DIEHLC	its xterm-256color. Strangely. though it is set in tmux.conf
2015-04-28 12:57:54	DIEHLC	set to screen-256color i mean
2015-04-28 12:58:17	Yaniel	tmux always sets it to screen or screen-256color based on what it was when tmux was started
2015-04-28 12:58:25	Yaniel	you shouldn't touch it in tmux.conf
2015-04-28 12:59:35	DIEHLC	well since it is showing xterm-256color in tmux, could that be the cause you think?

2015-04-28 13:04:45	Miblo	Weird, I didn't realise tmux changed "$TERM". urxvt has it as "rxvt-256color" but tmux, launched from the same terminal, has it as "screen".
2015-04-28 13:04:52	Kunsi	DIEHLC: may be. try it

2015-04-30 23:23:12	jdhore	Is there a way to do /buffer set across all open buffers?
2015-04-30 23:29:16	gb	DIEHLC: there is a themes script but it's very alpha still
2015-04-30 23:30:16	gb	most just /set their own color settings after setting up screen-256color term, etc
2015-04-30 23:30:54	gb	unfortunately colours are dependant on a combination of things not just weechat
2015-04-30 23:31:38	gb	one term might display magenta correctly and abother might display it as brown
2015-04-30 23:31:46	gb	another
2015-04-30 23:32:20	gb	so be careful about setting up weechat for only one term
2015-04-30 23:32:52	gb	especially if like me you ssh in from several architectures/versions of software
