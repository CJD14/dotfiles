I seem to have some permission problem that was caused by Arch Linux pacman install aparently is what I am finding out in my research. I get the error: NS_ERROR_FACTORY_NOT_REGISTERED (0x80040154) as soon as I go to create a new hard drive image and press okay. So its just a failing session creation I believe. Ive seen it could be a permission issue in the tmp

I believe  Arch is odd enough that even the official "any distro" Linux package doesn't work either, but I could be wrong, I haven't tried.  (From that message it sounds like the VirtualBox binary wasn't installed setuid, which it needs to be, which does sound like a packaging bug.)

2015-04-30 16:41:29	FireBeard	I have Win98/2K/XP running, plus a good few of 'misc' os'ses [warp, kolibrios, menuet, etc] just for fun
2015-04-30 16:41:46	DIEHLC	yeah Id like to try some Solaris/Open Solaris and BSD distros next. oh and ive been meaning to try MINIX
2015-04-30 16:42:25	FireBeard	Minix gives me MAJOR problems, haven't been able to get it fully up and running yet, not even with the supplied pre-built drive
2015-04-30 16:43:54	FireBeard	solaris and bsd are both boring to me, because they're essentially the same as linux, as in they use the same graphical drivers, DE's etc

2015-04-30 16:44:48	DIEHLC	thats unfortunate about minix. I just recently saw that it is actually older than Linux.

2015-04-30 16:46:45	FireBeard	there's no pre-built version of warp, so you have to install it yourself, which is a challenge-ish

2015-04-30 16:50:09	FireBeard	but it's quite a challenge if you're installing it for the first time, because it's such an illogical install process

2015-04-30 23:46:15	Nautilus	I just mean... the VM is a file on the HD yes, what is IT's extension?
2015-04-30 23:46:53	Nautilus	maybe that's the only file association it will do at this time.
2015-04-30 23:47:05	Nautilus	.box? .vbx? .something?

2015-05-01 00:19:37	Nautilus	Could also be that I have it backwards, passthrough skips the host OS.

2015-05-01 01:22:07	rfm	Gnomethrower: well, NAT network is supposed to provide a DNS server that basically forwards to whatever the host is using, so if DNS is working on the host it should work on the guests (assuming the guests config with DHCP, or statically with the same info.)    Do note https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_nat_service says DNS servers from loopback aren't passed to the NAT network, so make sure host has some others.
2015-05-01 01:23:29	Gnomethrower	rfm: If I set the DNS to, for example, Google DNS
2015-05-01 01:23:35	Gnomethrower	it wouldn't be aware of my local machines, would it?
2015-05-01 01:24:07	Gnomethrower	I guess what I'm asking is is it necessary for me to set up a DNS service like dnsmasq or BIND myself, or is there a simpler way to do it? I'm on the verge of installing pfSense to provide DNS and DHCP.../
2015-05-01 01:25:16	rfm	Gnomethrower: not unless your local machines are in the worldwide DNS.   If you want to have a "local zone" where names that only you know get resolved, you are going to have to run a local BIND inside the NAT network (and I'm not going to be able to help you, I gave up.)
2015-05-01 01:25:54	Gnomethrower	rfm: Thanks, that's all the clarification I need. I'll start with pfSense and "upgrade" to BIND/SAMBA4/AD later. :)
2015-05-01 01:27:38	rfm	Gnomethrower: don't forget the good old 1980's solution of  copying /etc/hosts files around, which is what I (mostly) use
2015-05-01 01:27:52	Gnomethrower	rfm: I'm trying to build a homelab for automating with Ansible
2015-05-01 01:27:58	Gnomethrower	I need something sort-of nice
